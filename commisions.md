### COMMISSIONS ARE CLOSED

### What can you commission?

You can basically contact me about any commission.  
I wont create any commissions that contain the following:

- Content or features that break Mojangs EULA or Terms of Service
- Anything that contains offensive or obscene content

I reserve the right to deny any commission for any reason.

### How does it work?

So you've got an idea for a mod? Just get in contact with me (see below) and we'll work out the terms.
Once all the terms are worked out, I'll begin work and keep you updated on the process.

Once I'm done I'll send you the final product.

### How much does it cost?
