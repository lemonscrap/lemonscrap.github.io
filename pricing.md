### Payment
I don't want to beat around the bush with pricing. I'd rather be honest, I think it's best for everyone involved.

All payments must go through PayPal.
It is required that a payment of 60% of the full price is payed before work is started. 
The final 40% will be payed before you recieve the final product.


### The base cost

It's hard to name a price upfront, as mods vary greatly. It's unlikely your mod will cost the EXACT amount listed on this page, but it should only be used as a guide.
I reserve the right to charge more or less than the prices list on this page.

#### Small Mod - $30
    - Just a few, small features

#### Medium Mod - $50
    - Not small, but not massive

#### Large Mod - $100
    - Decent sized mod

#### Very Large Mod - $150+
    - If it's a very large mod, we should talk some more.

****
All mods will contain these things, see below on pricing to modify these.

- The mod as descripted by you
- Open source on Github
- Hosted on Curseforge
    - I recieve 100% of curse points
- Textures created by me
- Licensed under MIT
- Free bugfixes for 60 days after initial release
- Free updates to minor Minecraft versions

### Extras

If you want to modify the contents of the base package, it may cost you a bit more, or it could save you a bit of money!

#### Open Source & licencing
By default, the mod will be open source with the MIT licence. 

If you would rather the mod be closed source, a fee of $15 will be added and an All Rights Reserved licence will be applied, and full ownership of code and assets will be transfered to you.

#### Self Hosting and/or Curse Points
By default, the mod will be hosted on Curseforge and I will recieve 100% of the curse points.
If you would like to host the mod off Curseforge or would like the curse points generated, a fee of $15 will be applied

#### Textures
By default, I will create the textures for the mod.

If you would like to use your own textures, the price of the mod will go down. This amount will depend on how many textures the mod contains.
If you would like me to get a professional artist to create you textures, the price will go up depending on how many textures the mod contains.

#### Bug Fixes
By default, the mod will get free bug fixes for 60 days after the inital release.

If you would like no bug fixes, the price of the mod will go down by $10 (Not recomended)
If you would like extended bug fixes or would like bug fixes after the inital 60 days, the price will go up depending on how large the mod is.

#### Major Minecraft Version Update
By default, I wont update to major Minecraft versions.

The price of a major Minecraft version update will depend on the size of the mod and how complicated the process to update to the new Minecraft version is.

### Notes
All prices are negotiable.
